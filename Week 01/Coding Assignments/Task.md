#### Coding assignment - Week 1

Your task is to create a single page website similar to [this](https://peaceful-everglades-06053.herokuapp.com/).

And deploy it to heroku.

After deploying it to heroku, you need to create a repository in github, and push the code into it.

Hint: When you deploy to heroku, git will automatically create a remote for you, you will have to change the remote to your own git repository to the push the code into your github account.
